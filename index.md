# Practice Website

This is my first Github-hosted website. It has information on markdown conventions that will be useful for anyone with questions on how to use markdown. 😃

# Markdown Conventions

Markdown is a lightweight markup 🖊️ language that is easy to read and write. It is commonly used for formatting text on the web. This document outlines some of the basic conventions for creating Markdown files.

## Headers

Headers are created using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols determines the header level.

Example:

# This is a level 1 header
## This is a level 2 header
### This is a level 3 header

## 😧 Emphasis
You can emphasize text using asterisks `*` or underscores `_`.

Example:
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__

## 😬 Lists
You can create ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

### 😳 Unordered List
Use asterisks `*`, plus `+`, or hyphens `-` to create a bulleted list.
Example:

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem A
  - Subitem B

### 😆 Ordered List
Use numbers followed by periods to create an ordered list.
Example:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## 🔗 Links
You can create links using square brackets `[]` for the link text and parentheses `()` for the URL.
Example:
[My website](https://github.com/gqcpm)

## 😊 Images
Images can be embedded using an exclamation mark `!`, followed by square brackets `[]` for alt text and parentheses `()` for the image URL.

## 💀 Code
Inline code can be enclosed in backticks `` ` ``.
Example:
Use the `print()` function to display text.

## 🪦 Code Blocks

To create a code block, enclose the code in triple backticks or indent it by four spaces.

Example:

\```
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
\```
